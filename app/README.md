Exam project - TrashGuide 2024

Description:
We pretend to work as a newly started web developer specializing in frontend development. In a typical work situation, I  act as the link between the media graphic designer and the backend programmer. My role is to convey the data provided by the programmer according to the instructions of the media graphic designer.

I have been tasked with building a frontend solution for the Waste Guide, which is a new initiative for sustainable waste sorting in the North Jutland Region. The region needs an application that can guide citizens in sorting their waste at a selection of the region's recycling stations. At the same time, the region also wants to receive feedback from users about their experiences at different recycling stations.

The media graphic designer has provided an approved design that I need to set up the site according to. The programmer has provided a web-based API that I can use to manage the site's content. The API is built in NodeJS and can be obtained from a Github repository, installed, and run on a local machine.
